What is Open Baton?
===================

OpenBaton is an open source project providing a comprehensive
implementation of the ETSI Management and Orchestration (MANO)
specification.

Open Baton is a ETSI NFV MANO compliant framework. Open Baton was part
of the OpenSDNCore (www.opensdncore.org) project started almost three
years ago by Fraunhofer FOKUS with the objective of providing a
compliant implementation of the ETSI NFV specification.

Open Baton is easily extensible. It integrates with OpenStack, and
provides a plugin mechanism for supporting additional VIM types. It
supports Network Service management either using a generic VNFM or
interoperating with VNF-specific VNFM. It uses different mechanisms
(REST or PUB/SUB) for interoperating with the VNFMs. It integrates with
additional components for the runtime management of a Network Service.
For instance, it provides autoscaling and fault management based on
monitoring information coming from the the monitoring system available
at the NFVI level.
